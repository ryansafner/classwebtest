      <description>Download .Rmd  Answer Key  For this homework, you may type up or handwrite the answers to each question. When you get to the R questions at the end, please attach a copy of your .R file (with comments!) of commands for each relevant question. For future homeworks, I will demonstrate how you can complete everything using R Markdown, but you will not be obligated to do so.</description>
