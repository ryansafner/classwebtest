For this homework, you may type up or handwrite the answers to each question. When you get to the *R* questions at the end, please attach a copy of your *.R* file (with comments!) of commands for each relevant question. For future homeworks, I will demonstrate how you can complete everything using *R Markdown*, but you will not be obligated to do so. 

## Getting Set Up 

Before we begin, start a new file with \texttt{File} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{New File} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{R Script}. As you work through this sheet in the console in `R`, also add (copy/paste) your commands that work into this new file. At the end, save it, and run to execute all of your commands at once. 

## Creating Objects

### 1. 

Create a vector called "me" with two objects, your first name, and your last name. Then call the vector to inspect it. Confirm it is a character class vector.

### 2. 

Create a vector called "x" with all the even integers from 2 to 10. 

### 3. 

Find the mean of x with `mean()`

### 4. 

Now take the following pdf of random variable $Y$:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = F, message = F, results="asis"}
library("tidyverse")
tribble(
  ~y, ~`p(y)`,
  2, 0.50,
  4, 0.25,
  6, 0.25
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(.,format="html")
```

Calculate the standard deviation "manually" using our table method. You can look at the source code of Lecture 4 for my example.  

- a. Create two vectors, one called $y.i$ and one called $p.i$, with the data above.
- b. Merge them into a data frame called $rv$ with `data.frame(y_i,p_i)`. Call `rv` to inspect it.
- c. Find the expected value of $Y$ by taking the sum of each value of `y.i` multiplied by `p.i` with the `sum()` command.
- d. Create a new column in `rv` called `deviations`, where you subtract the mean from each `y.i` value. Call `rv` again to make sure it's now there.
- e. Create another column in `rv` called `devsq`, where you square the deviations from part d. Call `rv` again to make sure it's now there.
- f. Now add another column in `rv` called `weighteddevsq`, where you multiply the squared deviations in part e. by the associated probability `p.i`. Call `rv` again to make sure it's now there.
- g. Finally, take the sum of `weighteddevsq` to get variance. Square root this to get standard deviation.

### 5. 

The mean height of adults is 65 inches, with a standard deviation of 4 inches. Use the normal distribution to find the probabilities of the following scenarios: 

- a. Find the probability of someone being *at least* 60 inches tall using `pnorm()`.
- b. Find the probability of someone being *at most* 60 inches tall.
- c. Find the probability of someone being between 61 and 69 inches tall. Why is this number familiar?
- d. Find the probability of someone being between 57 and 73 inches tall. Why is this number familiar?

## Playing with a Data Set 

For the following questions, use the `diamonds` dataset, included as part of `ggplot2`.

### 6. 

Install `ggplot2`

### 7. 

Load `ggplot2` with the `library()` command

### 8. 

Get the structure of the diamonds data.frame. What are the different variables and what kind of data does each contain? 

### 9. 

Get summary statistics for `carat`, `depth`, `table`, and `price`

### 10. 

`color`, `cut`, and `clarity` are categorical variables (factors). Use the `table()` command to generate frequency tables for each.

### 11. 

Now rerun the `summary()` command on the entire data frame

### 12. 

Plot a histogram of price. 

### 13. 

Plot a boxplot of price by diamond color.

## Execute your R Script

Save the R Script you created at the beginning and (hopefully) have been pasting all of your valid commands to. This creates a *.R* file wherever you choose to save it to. Now looking at the file in the upper left pane of *R Studio* look for the button in the upper right corner that says **Run**. Sit back and watch `R` redo everything you've carefully worked on, all at once.
