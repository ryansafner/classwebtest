For this homework, you may type up or handwrite the answers to each question. When you get to the *R* questions at the end, please attach a copy of your *.R* file (with comments!) of commands for each relevant question. For future homeworks, I will demonstrate how you can complete everything using *R Markdown*, but you will not be obligated to do so. 

# Theory & Concepts 

For the following questions, please answer the questions completely but succinctly (2-3 sentences). 

## 1

Explain the difference between exogeneity and endogeneity.

## 2 

Explain how conducting a randomized controlled experiment helps to identify the causal connection between two variables.

# Theory Problems

For the following questions, please *show all work* and explain answers as necessary. You may lose points if you only write the correct answer. You may use *R* to verify your answers, but you are expected to reach the answers in this section "manually." 

## 3

A college senior has applied for admission to two medical schools, *A* and *B*. She estimates the probability of acceptance at *A* at 0.7 and the probability of acceptance at *B* at 0.4 and the probability that she will be admitted to both at 0.2. What is the chance she will *not* be accepted at *either* school? (Consult the probability handout for basic probability rules.)

## 4

Suppose the probabilities of a visitor to Amazonâ€™s website and buying 0, 1, or 2 books are 0.2, 0.4, and 0.4 respectively. What are the *expected number* of books a visitor will purchase and the *standard deviation* of book purchases?

## 5

Scores on the SAT (out of 1600) are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 500 and standard deviation of 100.

- a. What is the probability of getting a score between a 400 and a 700?
- b. What is the probability of getting a score between a 300 and a 800?
- c. What is the probability of getting *at least* a 700?
- d. What is the probability of getting *at most* a 700?
- e. What is the probability of getting exactly a 500?

# R Problems

For the following problems, please attach/write the answers to each question on the same document as the previous problems, but also include a printed/attached (and commented!) *.R* script file of your commands to answer the questions. 

## 6

Using the "table" method of finding standard deviation for a random variable discussed in class, use *R* to find the standard deviation of the following discrete random variable, $X$, that has the following pdf:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
tribble(
  ~x, ~`p(x)`,
  0, 0.30,
  5, 0.50,
  10, 0.20,
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(.,format="html")
```

To jog your memory, standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the squared deviations from the mean weighted by the probability of the associated value of $X$.

## 7

Redo question 5 parts a-d using the `pnorm()` command in `R`.

## 8 

We will use the dataset `mpg`, which is a part of the `ggplot2` package, and describes fuel economy data from the EPA on models of cars released between 1999-2008. Load (or install, if you don't have) the `ggplot2` package in order to use `mpg`.

- a. What variables are included in the `mpg` data? (You don't need to explain them, they aren't well-documented, only write down they are).
- b. Find summary statistics for `hwy` and `cty` (miles per gallon on the highway and in the city, respectively).
- c. How many different manufacturers are in the data, and how many cars from each manufacturer?
- d. How many different classes are in the data, and how many cars from each class?
- e. Plot two histograms, one of `hwy` and one of `cty`
- f. Plot a boxplot of `hwy` mpg by `manufacturer`. Which manufacturer appears to have the highest average highway mpg? Which appears to have the largest variance? Which appears to have outliers? (There are too many manufacturers for `R` to print them on the axis by default, but they are listed in alphabetical order, check using your answers to part c.)
- g. Plot a boxplot of `hwy` by `class`. Which car classes appear to have the highest average highway mpg? Highest variance?
