<p>For this homework, you may type up or handwrite the answers to each question. When you get to the <em>R</em> questions at the end, please attach a copy of your <em>.R</em> file (with comments!) of commands for each relevant question. For future homeworks, I will demonstrate how you can complete everything using <em>R Markdown</em>, but you will not be obligated to do so.</p>
<h2 id="theory-concepts">Theory &amp; Concepts</h2>
<p>For the following questions, please answer the questions completely but succinctly (2-3 sentences).</p>
<h3 id="section">1</h3>
<p>Explain the difference between exogeneity and endogeneity.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">2</h3>
<p>Explain how conducting a randomized controlled experiment helps to identify the causal connection between two variables.</p>
<h2 id="theory-problems">Theory Problems</h2>
<p>For the following questions, please <em>show all work</em> and explain answers as necessary. You may lose points if you only write the correct answer. You may use <em>R</em> to verify your answers, but you are expected to reach the answers in this section “manually.”</p>
<h3 id="section-2">3</h3>
<p>A college senior has applied for admission to two medical schools, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. She estimates the probability of acceptance at <em>A</em> at 0.7 and the probability of acceptance at <em>B</em> at 0.4 and the probability that she will be admitted to both at 0.2. What is the chance she will <em>not</em> be accepted at <em>either</em> school? (Consult the probability handout for basic probability rules.)</p>
<h3 id="section-3">4</h3>
<p>Suppose the probabilities of a visitor to Amazon’s website and buying 0, 1, or 2 books are 0.2, 0.4, and 0.4 respectively. What are the <em>expected number</em> of books a visitor will purchase and the <em>standard deviation</em> of book purchases?</p>
<h3 id="section-4">5</h3>
<p>Scores on the SAT (out of 1600) are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 500 and standard deviation of 100.</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is the probability of getting a score between a 400 and a 700?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is the probability of getting a score between a 300 and a 800?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is the probability of getting <em>at least</em> a 700?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is the probability of getting <em>at most</em> a 700?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is the probability of getting exactly a 500?</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="r-problems">R Problems</h2>
<p>For the following problems, please attach/write the answers to each question on the same document as the previous problems, but also include a printed/attached (and commented!) <em>.R</em> script file of your commands to answer the questions.</p>
<h3 id="section-5">6</h3>
<p>Using the “table” method of finding standard deviation for a random variable discussed in class, use <em>R</em> to find the standard deviation of the following discrete random variable, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, that has the following pdf:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">
x
</th>
<th style="text-align:right;">
p(x)
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:right;">
0
</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">
0.3
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:right;">
5
</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">
0.5
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:right;">
10
</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">
0.2
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To jog your memory, standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the squared deviations from the mean weighted by the probability of the associated value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>

<p>Redo question 5 parts a-d using the <code>pnorm()</code> command in <code>R</code>.</p>
<h3 id="section-7">8</h3>
<p>We will use the dataset <code>mpg</code>, which is a part of the <code>ggplot2</code> package, and describes fuel economy data from the EPA on models of cars released between 1999-2008. Load (or install, if you don’t have) the <code>ggplot2</code> package in order to use <code>mpg</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What variables are included in the <code>mpg</code> data? (You don’t need to explain them, they aren’t well-documented, only write down they are).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Find summary statistics for <code>hwy</code> and <code>cty</code> (miles per gallon on the highway and in the city, respectively).</li>
</ol></li>

<li>How many different manufacturers are in the data, and how many cars from each manufacturer?</li>

<li><ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Plot a boxplot of <code>hwy</code> mpg by <code>manufacturer</code>. Which manufacturer appears to have the highest average highway mpg? Which appears to have the largest variance? Which appears to have outliers? (There are too many manufacturers for <code>R</code> to print them on the axis by default, but they are listed in alphabetical order, check using your answers to part c.)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Plot a boxplot of <code>hwy</code> by <code>class</code>. Which car classes appear to have the highest average highway mpg? Highest variance?</li>
